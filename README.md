# Voice-classification

Attempts at classifying the emotional content of human voices using the RAVDESS dataset. Follows popular approach of spectral decomposition of the individual voice recordings. 

Afterwards, two NN architectures are tested: a regular NN, consisting of 3 layers as well as a convolutional NN. Performance is a bit higher for the latter. Implementation with TensorFlow/Keras.
